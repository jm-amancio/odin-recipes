        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>All the flavor you love in Filipino chicken adobo without hours of marinating thanks to the Instant Pot. Serve over rice, if desired.</p>

        <!-- "Ingredients" here --> 
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black peppercorns, roughly cracked</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped scallions</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- "Steps" here --> 
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, olive oil, brown sugar, and crushed peppercorns in a bowl until sugar is dissolved. Stir bay leaves into the sauce. </li>
            <li>Line the bottom of a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) with onion slices. Place chicken thighs on top of onions and pour vinegar-soy sauce over top. Close and lock the lid.</li>
            <li>Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 10 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the quick-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. Using tongs, transfer thighs to the prepared baking sheet, skin-side up. Select Saute function and cook until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler to high.</li>
            <li>Place chicken under the preheated broiler, and broil until skin is crispy, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer thighs to a serving plate and spoon sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped scallions.            </li>
        </ol>
